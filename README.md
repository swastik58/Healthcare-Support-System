###  Traffic-Light-Automation

The idea of the project is to automate traffic light system using **Mediapipe,OpenCV and Arduino.** We have taken the idea of Handtracking using the Mediapipe Library to count the finger's to light up the LED's. 


```
-Encoding
```
- 1 fingers--> Green Light
- 2 fingers--> Yellow Light
- 3 fingers --> Red Light
```
```

### What is Mediapipe?

**MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines. MediaPipe is a framework for building multimodal (eg. video, audio, any time series data), cross platform (i.e Android, iOS, web, edge devices) applied ML pipelines.**

### How to set up locally?
